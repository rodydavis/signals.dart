/// The `effect` function is the last piece that makes everything reactive. When you access a signal inside its callback function, that signal and every dependency of said signal will be activated and subscribed to. In that regard it is very similar to [`computed(fn)`](/core/computed). By default all updates are lazy, so nothing will update until you access a signal inside `effect`.

/// ```dart
/// import 'package:signals/signals.dart';
///
/// final name = signal("Jane");
/// final surname = signal("Doe");
/// final fullName = computed(() => name.value + " " + surname.value);
///
/// // Logs: "Jane Doe"
/// effect(() => print(fullName.value));
///
/// // Updating one of its dependencies will automatically trigger
/// // the effect above, and will print "John Doe" to the console.
/// name.value = "John";
/// ```
///
/// You can destroy an effect and unsubscribe from all signals it was subscribed to, by calling the returned function.
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:signals/signals.dart';
///
/// final name = signal("Jane");
/// final surname = signal("Doe");
/// final fullName = computed(() => name.value + " " + surname.value);
///
/// // Logs: "Jane Doe"
/// final dispose = effect(() => print(fullName.value));
///
/// // Destroy effect and subscriptions
/// dispose();
///
/// // Update does nothing, because no one is subscribed anymore.
/// // Even the computed `fullName` signal won't change, because it knows
/// // that no one listens to it.
/// surname.value = "Doe 2";
/// ```
///
/// ## Cleanup Callback
///
/// You can also return a cleanup function from an effect. This function will be called when the effect is destroyed.
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:signals/signals.dart';
///
/// final s = signal(0);

///
/// You can also pass a callback to `effect` that will be called when the effect is destroyed.
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:signals/signals.dart';
///
/// final s = signal(0);
///
/// final dispose = effect(() {
///   print(s.value);
/// }, onDispose: () => print('Effect destroyed'));
///
/// // Destroy effect and subscriptions
/// dispose();
/// ```
///
/// ## Warning About Cycles
///
/// Mutating a signal inside an effect will cause an infinite loop, because the effect will be triggered again. To prevent this, you can use [`untracked(fn)`](/core/untracked) to read a signal without subscribing to it.
